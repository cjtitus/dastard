# DASTARD TCP PORTS

(Last revision: 2 September 2020.)

DASTARD uses a series of TCP ports for communications with its GUI control
clients (such as [DASTARD-Commander](https://github.com/usnistgov/dastard-commander)) and to publish triggered pulse data for plotting
([Microscope](https://github.com/usnistgov/microscope)).

These ports are numbered sequencially from a *base port* number. By default,
this number is **BASE=5500**. We might allow this number to be set at the
DASTARD command-line, but for now it's a constant.  The TCP ports are:

* **5500** (base+0): **Control**. JSON-RPC port for controlling DASTARD.  (JSON-RPC = "Remote Procedure Calls" specificed by JSON data format). Message format is defined by [json-rpc version 1.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification_v1).
* **5501** (base+1): **Status**. ZMQ PUB port where DASTARD reports its status to all control GUIs.
* **5502** (base+2): **Pulses**. ZMQ PUB port where DASTARD puts all pulse records. Subscribe by 4-byte channel number. These are for Microscope to use, so it can plot data.
* **5503** (base+3): **Secondary records**. ZMQ PUB port, same as BASE+2, except that here we put only the secondary triggered records (i.e from a group trigger).
* **5504** (base+4): **Pulse summaries**. ZMQ PUB port. Just has summary info and model fit coefficients.

### JSON-RPC commands (BASE+0)

Hmm. Should document these.

### Status messages (BASE+1)
Format is a text message-key (as a ZMQ frame) then a status block in JSON format. The messages are meant to be adequate to inform all Dastard control clients (the `dastard-commander` GUI, or others) everything they need to know about the Dastard internal state. Message keys include:

* **ALIVE**: a "heartbeat" message, whether data source is active, time and MB of data since previous ALIVE message. Expect <5 seconds apart.
* **STATUS**: what data source is active; idling or running;  What # of rows, columns, channels, samples, and pre-trigger samples.
* **TRIGGER**: contains the complete trigger configuration (publish only when it changes). An efficiency: send only 1 copy of each unique state, along with a list of the channel numbers that are in that specific state.
* **TRIGCOUPLING**: whether FB->Error or Error->FB trigger coupling is active, or neither.
* **STATELABEL**: the current "experiment state".
* **SIMPULSE**: contains the configuration of the Simulated Pulse data source.
* **TRIANGLE**: contains the configuration of the Triangle Wave data source.
* **LANCERO**: contains the configuration of the Lancero data source (e.g., which cards to use, fiber mask, etc.).
* **ABACO**: contains the configuration of the Abaco data source (e.g., which ring buffers to use).
* **TRIGGERRATE**: how many triggers have been counted (array-wide) over some duration, plus the clock time of last checked sample.
* **NUMBERWRITTEN**: counts how many records have been written to file.
* **DATADROP**: counts data frames dropped from an active data source (since previous message).
* **EXTERNALTRIGGER**: counts how many external triggers have been seen (since previous message).
* **TESMAP**: characterizes the entire TES array geometry.
* **TESMAPFILE**: names the TES array map file being used.
* **MIX**: TDM mixing state. Like TRIGGER, publish all values that match as a block of identically mixed channels.
* **WRITING**: contains output file information (type, filename, writing status stop/go/pause) (publish on change).
* **CHANNELNAMES**: a list of the unique channel names.

### Primary and secondary pulse records (BASE+2 and BASE+3)

Each message on these ports consists of a single pulse record. The first 2 bytes are an int16 channel number, so that programs can subscribe to specific channels. The message format is found in file BINARY_FORMATS.md

### Pulse summaries (BASE+4)

Each message on these ports consists _summaries_ of a single pulse record. The first 2 bytes are an int16 channel number, so that programs can subscribe to specific channels. The message format is found in file BINARY_FORMATS.md
