# Take a wireshark packet sniffer data file ($INF) and generate an output
# file $OUTF containing only the raw UDP packet contents for the first 4 packets.
# I happen to know that the first 3 packets are external triggers, packets of length
# 0x260 with some wireshark junk of length 0x4c between them, and the first starting at
# 0x14a. Then the 4th packet is a longer packet (length 0x1060) of ÂµMUX data.
# Use this knowledge to surgically remove these 4 packets and store in $OUTF.

# This script probably isn't good for re-use, but it can document how the test
# data file timer_packets.bin was generated.
